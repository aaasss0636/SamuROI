### Cell population
In this folder, you will find an ipython notebook and corresponding files to give you a working example for using SamuROI on cell populations. The `data.npy` file is the image sequence to be analyzed. 

Note: this example requires that [ilastik](http://ilastik.org/download.html) is installed.

An example ilastik project file `GCaMP.ilp` is included, which will be executed by the ilastik functions called in the .ipynb script.
